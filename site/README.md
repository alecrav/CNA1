COMPUTER NETWORKING - ASSINGMENT 3

ENRICO BENEDETTINI (Task A, B, C, D, E, H )
ALESASNDRO CRAVIOGLIO (Task A, B, D, E, F, G, H)
ALFIO VAVASSORI (Task A, B, C, D, F, G, H)

We decided to go with HTTP 1.0 at the start, adding 1.1 if we had time (we did not)
We started to go task by task, and after a while we all worked a bit on every task.

The personal sites are not really well tought of and designed, because we wanted to focus more on the technical part of the server.

We decided to use Python, because it is simpler to write and understand, and we felt it was the right choice.
