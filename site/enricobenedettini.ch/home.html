      Hi, I am Enrico Benedettini, and I study computer science at USI.
      Here on the left you can see an exact representation of Alfio when he tries to code something.
      I decided to study computer science because I am intrigue by the logic behind the programs
      that we use every day. In the end, we managed to make rocks think!

      I am from Cesena, Italy, a beautiful city very close to the sea.
      Cesena was originally an Umbrian or Etruscan town, later known as Caesena.
      After a brief spell under Gaulish rule, it was taken over by Romans in the
      3rd century BC. It was a garrison town of strategic importance which was
      destroyed in the wars between Gaius Marius and Sulla. Pliny mentions
      the wines of Cesena as among the best.
      I have to agree with Pliny, because our wine is fantastic.

      Here is a picture of a raspberry.
      Raspberries are an important commercial fruit crop,
      widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.
      The raspberry is the edible fruit of a multitude of
      plant species in the genus Rubus. The major kinds
      cultivated are red, black, purple, and blue raspberries.
      The berries should be picked when fully ripe and conveyed
      to the factory in crates of the shallow boxes to prevent
      bruising or crushing of the fruit. The berries should be
      handled promptly when received at the factory, as they tend
      to grow mould quickly.
