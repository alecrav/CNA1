        Hi, I am Alfio Vavassori, and I study computer science at USI.
        Here on the left you can see an exact representation of me when I try to code something.
        I decided to study computer science because I am intrigue by the logic behind the programs
        that we use every day. In the end, we managed to make rocks think!

        I am passionate about photography and videomaking, a passion that started
        when i traveled to japan with a couple of friends of mine.
        It is now my side job and it has costed me a lot of money, but the satisfaction 
        that it gives is unmatched.

        Here is a picture of a banana, fruit of the genus Musa, 
        of the family Musaceae, one of the most important fruit crops of the world.
         The banana is grown in the tropics, and, though it is most 
         widely consumed in those regions, it is valued worldwide for its flavour, 
         nutritional value, and availability throughout the year. 
         Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, 
         though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings.
          They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. 
          Cooking varieties, or plantains, are starchy rather than sweet 
          and are grown extensively as a staple food source in tropical regions; 
          they are cooked when ripe or immature.
